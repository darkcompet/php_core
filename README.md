# Dk PHP

Dk Library for PHP, one in series of Dk libraries.

>About Dk Libraries: acts as a `bridge` between a framework with the app.
>It supports us write code with one style for different frameworks or libraries,
>so we don't need take an effort to remember name or usage of classes, functions...
>inside that framework or library.
